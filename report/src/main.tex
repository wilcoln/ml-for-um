\begin{abstract}
  A fundamental objective of human-computer interaction research is to make systems more usable, more useful, and to provide users with experiences fitting their specific background, knowledge and objectives. Specifically, today we want systems to do the "right" thing at the "right" time in the "right" way. Designers of human-computer systems face the formidable task of writing software for millions of users (at design time) while making it work as if it were designed for each individual user (only known at use time). User modeling research has attempted to address these issues. In this article,
  I will provide an assessment of the current state of the art, a review of all the main researches that have been conducted in the field and its main tracks, essentially based on the papers submitted and accepted to the ACM UMAP international conference, which is the premier international conference dedicated to the subject of user modeling. A special emphasis is given to machine learning algorithms used to tackle challenges encountered in the field.

\section{Introduction}

All full papers and posters (short papers) submitted to some SBC conference,
including any supporting documents, should be written in English or in
Portuguese. The format paper should be A4 with single column, 3.5 cm for upper
margin, 2.5 cm for bottom margin and 3.0 cm for lateral margins, without
headers or footers. The main font must be Times, 12 point nominal size, with 6
points of space before each paragraph. Page numbers must be suppressed.

Full papers must respect the page limits defined by the conference.
Conferences that publish just abstracts ask for \textbf{one}-page texts.
