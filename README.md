# Machine Learning for User modeling: A State of the Art

## Introduction
A fundamental objective of human-computer interaction research isto make systems more usable,  more useful,  and to provide users with experi-ences fitting their specific background, knowledge and objectives.  Specifically,today we want systems to do therightthing at therighttime in therightway.Designers of human-computer systems face the formidable task of writing soft-ware for millions of users (at design time) while making it work as if it weredesigned for each individual user (only known at use time).User modeling re-search has attempted to address these issues.
